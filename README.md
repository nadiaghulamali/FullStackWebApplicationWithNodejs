Node.js Full Stack Application

A Full Stack Web Application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

üìã Project Description

This project is a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It demonstrates modern web development practices, including server-side development, database management, and user authentication.


Key features of the application include:

Building high-quality applications with Node.js and Express.
Managing and storing data using MongoDB and Mongoose.
Creating RESTful APIs for the application.
User authentication with sessions

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js, simplifying routing and server management.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB, enabling data modeling and validation.

üöÄ Features
RESTful API: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality.
Database Integration: Store and retrieve data from a MongoDB database.
Modern JavaScript: Usage of async/await, promises, and other ES6/ES7 features.

üîß Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Setup MongoDB
Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or use a MongoDB cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas). Update the database connection string in your project‚Äôs config or index.js.

mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/node-js-test-blog', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
4. Run the application
bash
Copy code
npm start

The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

üå± How to Use
